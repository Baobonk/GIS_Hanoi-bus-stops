apparently The search thing finally worked, but right now the only way it can search is by the giant gahongas of a blue marker that lags the entire system everytime you open the html file. Its either keep it for the search to work, or delete it and the search refuses to function. 
The problem relies on the leaflet search function that calls a marker whenever it need to search for something. Only option is to 
- Try to remove the marker while keeping the search
- Lower the radius for the map and hope that it doesnt crash (it wont)
